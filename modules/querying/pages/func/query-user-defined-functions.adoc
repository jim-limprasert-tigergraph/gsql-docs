= Query User-Defined Functions
:pp: {plus}{plus}

In GSQL, users can supplement the language by defining their own query user-defined functions (query UDF) in C{pp}. Query UDFs can be called in queries and subqueries to perform a set of defined actions and return a value like the built-in functions.

This page introduces the process to define a query UDF. Once defined, the new functions are added into GSQL automatically the next time GSQL is executed.

Query UDFs are user-editable in the form of an `.hpp` file locally on your machine.
 Creating, editing, or removing Query UDFs is done by downloading them from the server, editing the file, and re-uploading through `GET` and `PUT` commands.

Uploading and downloading the UDF file (`ExprFunctions.hpp`) requires the following xref:tigergraph-server:user-access:roles-and-privileges.adoc#_privileges[privileges]:

** The `GET` command requires the `READ_FILE` privilege.
** The `PUT` command requires the `WRITE_FILE` privilege.

WARNING: It is strongly recommended that you enable GSQL user authentication by changing the password of the default user `tigergraph` to protect your UDF files.
If you don't enable user authentication, anyone with GSQL shell access can log in as the default user with `superuser` privileges and modify your files.

== Define a query UDF

Below are the steps to add a Query UDF to GSQL:

=== Step 1: Download current query UDF file

Use the `GET ExprFunctions` command in GSQL to download the current list of functions into a local file. The path can be absolute or relative to your current directory, but the file extension must be `.hpp`:

[source,gsql]
----
GSQL > GET ExprFunctions TO "/example/path/to/ExprFunctions.hpp"
GSQL > GET ExprFunctions TO "./ExprFunctions.hpp"

----

If your query UDF requires a user-defined struct or helper function, also use the `GET ExprUtil` command to download the current `ExprUtil` file:

[source,gsql]
----
GSQL > GET ExprUtil TO "/example/path/ExprUtil.hpp"
----

=== Step 2: Define C{pp} function

Define the C{pp} function inside the UDF file you just downloaded in Step 1. The definition of the function should include the keyword `inline`.

Below is a list of data types and where each is allowed in a function.

.Allowed Data Types
|===
|Data Type | Argument | Return | Function Body
| `bool` | Yes | Yes | Yes
| `int` | Yes | Yes | Yes
| `uint` | Yes | Yes | Yes
| `float` | Yes | Yes | Yes
| `double` | Yes | Yes | Yes
| `string` | Yes | Yes | Yes
| `std::string` | *No* | *No* | Yes
| xref:accumulators.adoc[Accumulators] | Yes | Yes | Yes

| All other C{pp} data types | *No* | *No* | Yes
|===

If the function requires a user-defined struct or helper function, define it in the `ExprUtil` file you downloaded in Step 1.

Below is an example of a query UDF definition that includes two separate functions. The first function returns `true` if the passed value is greater than 3, and the second reverses a string.

.New code in ExprFunctions.hpp

[source,c++]
----
#include <algorithm>  // for std::reverse
inline bool greater_than_three (double x) {
  return x > 3;
}

inline string reverse(string str){
  std::reverse(str.begin(), str.end());
  return str;
}
----



[CAUTION]
====
If any code in `ExprFunctions.hpp` or `ExprUtil.hpp` causes a compilation error, GSQL will be unable to install _any_ new queries, whether containing user-defined functions or not.
====


=== Step 3: Upload files

After you have defined the function, use the `PUT` command to upload the files you modified.

[source,gsql]
----
GSQL > PUT ExprFunctions FROM "/path/to/udf_file.hpp"
PUT ExprFunctions successfully.
GSQL > PUT ExprUtil FROM "/path/to/utils_file.hpp"
PUT ExprUtil successfully.
----

The `PUT` command will automatically upload the files to all nodes in a cluster, overwriting any existing files that contain UDFs.

Once the files are uploaded, you will be able to call the query UDF the next time GSQL is executed. This includes the next time you start the GSQL shell or execute GSQL scripts from a bash shell. If you are using GraphStudio, however, you will be able to use the queries without needing to refresh the page.

.Example of a GSQL query that uses the UDF

[source,gsql]
----
CREATE QUERY udfExample() FOR GRAPH minimalNet {
  DOUBLE x;
  BOOL y;

  x = 3.5;
  PRINT greater_than_three(x);
  y = greater_than_three(2.5);
  PRINT y;

  PRINT reverse("abc");
}
----



== Example

Suppose you are working in a distributed environment and want to add a function `rng()` that that returns a random double between 0 and 1.

Start by downloading the current UDF file with the `GET` command. In this example, we will place our download in the working directory and use the name `udf.hpp` in contrast to above, where it was named `ExprFunctions.hpp`.

[source,gsql]
----
GSQL > GET ExprFunctions TO "./udf.hpp"
----

In the downloaded file, add the function definition for the `rng()` function.

.udf.hpp

[source,c++]
----
inline double rng() {
    std::random_device rd;
    std::mt19937 gen(rd());
    std::uniform_real_distribution < double > distribution(0.0, 1.0);

    return distribution(gen);
    }

----

After adding your query, use the `PUT` command to upload the file. This will upload the file to all nodes in a cluster:

[source,gsql]
----
GSQL > PUT ExprFunctions FROM "./udf.hpp"
PUT ExprFunctions successfully.
----

The UDF has now been added to GSQL. You can add it to a query, then run the commands `INSTALL QUERY` and `RUN QUERY` to test the `rng()` function. The following commands demonstrate the process with a one-line query called `rngExample` that simply prints the output of the new function `rng()`.

[source,gsql]
----
GSQL > CREATE QUERY rngExample() FOR GRAPH example_graph {PRINT rng();}
Successfully created queries: [rngExample].

GSQL > INSTALL QUERY rngExample
Start installing queries, about 1 minute ...
rngExample query: curl -X GET 'http://127.0.0.1:9000/query/example_graph/rngExample'. Add -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" if authentication is enabled.
Select 'm1' as compile server, now connecting ...
Node 'm1' is prepared as compile server.

[=========================================================================================] 100% (1/1)
Query installation finished.
