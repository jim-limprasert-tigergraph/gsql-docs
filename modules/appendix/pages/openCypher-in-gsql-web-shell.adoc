= Writing openCypher Queries in GSQL Web Shell

To write openCypher queries in the GSQL Web Shell, follow these steps:

NOTE: INTERPRET QUERY does not support distributed query mode

. Open GSQL Web Shell in your browser and log in.

. Run `INTERPRET OPENCYPHER QUERY`
[source,gsql]
INTERPRET OPENCYPHER QUERY () FOR GRAPH communication_mau {
MATCH (u:user)
WHERE u.id = "test"
RETURN u
}

. Create an openCypher query
[source,gsql]
CREATE DISTRIBUTED OPENCYPHER QUERY get_user_by_id2() FOR GRAPH communication_mau {
MATCH (u:user)
WHERE u.id = "test"
RETURN u
}

. Install the openCypher query
[source,gsql]
INSTALL QUERY get_user_by_id2

. Run installed openCypher query
[source, gsql]
RUN QUERY get_user_by_id2()
